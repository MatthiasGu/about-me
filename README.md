# My homepage

This repository has links to some of my code outside of work. Keep in mind some of it dates back many years...

Please get in touch via LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/mj-gudenas/ if you have any questions or need additional samples. Not all of my side projects are made public.

## Project contributions

Some group projects that I have contributed to:

https://github.com/h-dong/serina - several features

I do consulting / development work for early stage start-ups. If you would like me for your project, please get in touch via LinkedIn. I am currently fully booked, but I could perhaps get you some help.

Unfortunately, I cannot share the details of my work for pre-fund start-ups. I can provide generic code samples of the projects with proprietary information removed - please get in touch.
